## installation

### running locally with python installed

to install the required dependencies, open your command prompt or terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to run the app in your browser, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run bg_remove.py
```
<br /> <br /> 
### running on jupyter notebook or google colab

this approach requires a few steps to run the streamlit code. streamlit is a python library used for creating data science and machine learning web applications. google colab, on the other hand, is a cloud-based platform where you can run python code in a jupyter notebook-like environment. streamlit code can be run in colab by following these steps:

install the required packages using the following commands:

```bash
pip install rembg==2.0.50
pip install Pillow==9.3.0
pip install streamlit==1.21.0
pip install numba==0.57
pip install numpy==1.23.0
```

1. you need to create a file, `app.py` (name can be anything) where you will write the streamlit code to run it on the web.

```bash
%%writefile app.py
```

3. the following command retrieves your external IP address using wget.

```bash
!wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
```

3. after obtaining the external IP, run the following command to set up a tunnel and access the streamlit app on the web:

```bash
streamlit run app.py & npx localtunnel --port 8501
```

4.   `npx localtunnel --port 8501` uses `npx localtunnel` to expose the locally running streamlit app to the internet. the app is hosted on port 8501, and localtunnel provides a public URL through which the app can be accessed. the command will provide a URL. open that URL in your web browser and paste your external IP as the tunnel password to access the streamlit app on the web.
